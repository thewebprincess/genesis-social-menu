genesis-social-menu
===================

This code is essentially a fork of that written by Justin Tadlock using attribute selectors to display social icons.  In this instance I'm using Font Awesome icons as there's a different range of icons available than the genericons that Justin uses.

This code is being placed on the genesis_header hook and as I was using it in the sixteen nine theme which places the footer text in the fixed vertical header I used the hierarchy to place it just before the footer text. You could of course place this code where you wish on any of the other genesis (or WordPress) hooks.
